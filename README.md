# M365-Checks-Agent
This repository provides access to the M365 Checks Copilot agent solution, making it available for everyone to use. Happy building!

<b>Copilot Agent Package Overview</b>

Welcome to the M365 Checks Copilot Agent Package, a foundational toolkit designed to kickstart your AI-powered workflows. This package provides essential building blocks to help users integrate and customise their own Copilot-based agent, but it is deliberately not a fully complete solution.

‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Why is this package incomplete?</b>

Every business has unique needs when it comes to workflow automation, data storage, and process execution. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, this package is designed to prompt users to think critically about:
- Which processes best suit their specific business workflows
- How collected data should be stored, processed, and secured
- What additional flows might be required to achieve optimal functionality

‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>What‚Äôs Included?</b>

This repository comes equipped with the core framework needed to operate a Copilot agent, including:
- Agent Initialisation ‚Äì Basic setup and configuration
- Data Collection Hooks ‚Äì Example integrations to collect relevant inputs
- Process Execution ‚Äì Predefined flows for standard agent interactions

‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>What‚Äôs Not Included</b>
Users will still need to build out additional requirements for each step of the agent‚Äôs workflow, such as:
- Custom data storage solutions tailored to their needs
- Specialised workflow automation beyond basic examples
- Any security enhancements to protect sensitive data
  
‚ÑπÔ∏èüîß <b>How to Get Started</b> - 
Clone the repository, explore the provided examples, and start refining your own agent process. The flexibility of this package allows users to construct their own optimal workflow, ensuring a more tailored and scalable solution.
